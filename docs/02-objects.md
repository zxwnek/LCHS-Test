# Prepare Collection Objects

must be jpg or pdf

scanning guidelines

file naming guidelines

copy to `objects` folder in project

Put your objects (jpgs or pdfs) in `objects` folder, ensuring that they match the `filename` column of your metadata. 
For the easiest set up, the filename should match the indexid + file extension.

Put small display images (thumbnails) in `objects/thumbs` folder, ensuring that they have the same filename as the object, with `_sm` at the end. 
Note, while objects might be jpg or pdf, all items will have a display image that is a jpg.

[create thumbnails using imagemagick](create-thumbs.md)
